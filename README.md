## Things I learned

1. Create a store in index.js Use configureStore from '@reduxjs/toolkit'. Wrap my App component in a Provider component passing store as props.
2. I need to create a features folder where the logic of the state will be stored.
3. Set the inital state of my reducer. 
4. Create actions logic.
5. Export the actions and reducer.

## Important Notes

1. useSelector :  use this to access the state.
2. useDispatch :  use this to modify the state.
3. Always put curly braces for actions.
